== Prerequisite
* At least one unterminated TigerGraph Cloud solution on Azure

In the pop-up window, choose Azure as your network platform.
Then choose the region of the platform you want to initiate the peering connection from.
Click btn:[Next].

=== 2. Add TigerGraph Cloud to your Azure tenant
In the Peered VPC tab, fill in your link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenan[Azure tenant ID] and your VN ID (Resource ID for your VN).
Click btn:[Next].

Click on the link in the instructions to add TigerGraph Cloud to your tenant.
Doing so opens a new tab, and if authorization is successful, it will redirect you back to the cloud portal.
You can now safely close this tab.

=== 3. Assign Network Contributor role to TigerGraph Cloud VN Peerer
From the Azure portal, navigate to btn:[Virtual Networks] and choose the network you are peering with.
Then navigate to menu:Access Control[Add > Add role assignment].
