= Create a New Solution

In this tutorial, you will learn how to provision a new TigerGraph Cloud solution.

== Procedure

=== 1. Navigate to My Solutions page

After logging into your TigerGraph Cloud account, click *My Solutions* on the left side menu to go to the *My Solutions* page.

=== 2. Click Create Solution

On the My Solutions page, click *Create Solution.*

=== 3. Select version and starter kit

Not all TigerGraph versions that are offered on-prem are offered on TigerGraph Cloud. In the dropdown list, choose the version of TigerGraph you want to run.

TigerGraph Cloud Starter Kits are built with sample graph data schema, dataset, and queries focused on a specific use case ***to help you get started quickly*.** Most of our starter kits have a https://www.tigergraph.com/starterkits/[demo video] that walks you through the schema and the queries built for its use case. If you wish to proceed with your own schema and data, select *Blank.*

After choosing the starter kit, scroll down to the bottom and click *Next*.

=== *4. Configure your instance*

==== *4.1. Choose a cloud provider*

The choice of cloud provider affects the configuration options for the available instance types and disk sizes, network latency for accessing your solution, the geographic location of your solution, and the cost of running your solutions. For more information, see xref:cloud-providers-and-regions.adoc[Cloud Providers and Regions].

==== 4.2. Choose an instance type (free or paid)

Each instance type indicates its vCPU and RAM specifications as well as the hourly rate for running the instance. For suggestions on choosing the right instance type and disk storage, see xref:sizing-and-scaling.adoc[Sizing and Scaling].

In this step, you choose between the free tier and the paid tiers for your solution.
The *TG.Free* tier is free, while all others require you to either use the $25 credit that comes with every new account or xref:billing:manage-payment-methods.adoc[have a valid payment method on file]

Free-tier solutions are also subject to service limits. For more details, please see the page on xref:reference:service-limits.adoc[].

The cost to run each solution is shown in each button.
In addition to this cost, when solutions are inactive but not yet terminated, there is a separate data storage fee for keeping data present on the server.
See xref:reference:README.adoc[the Reference page] for each cloud provider for more information about each billing structure.

==== 4.3. Choose a region

Region reflects the physical location of the server running your solutions. It also affects the network latency for accessing your solution.

==== 4.4. Choose a disk size

Disk storage refers to the root disk that is attached to your instance. If you need help choosing the right disk storage, see xref:sizing-and-scaling.adoc[Sizing and Scaling].

[CAUTION]
====
To ensure your solution has enough disk storage, TigerGraph mandates that any solution's disk size must be *at least 3 times the size of the solution instance's RAM*. For example, if you choose an instance type that has a RAM of 64 GB, then the solution's disk size must be more than 192 GB.
====

=== 5. Enter cluster settings

==== 5.1. Choose a partitioning factor

In a xref:3.2@tigergraph-server:ha:ha-cluster.adoc[High Availability (HA) cluster,] the partitioning factor refers to the number of parts or components your graph data is split into, which also equals the number of instances that collectively store one copy of the full graph.

If you only need a single instance to store your entire graph, enter 1 as your partition factor.

==== 5.2. Choose a replication factor

The replication factor is the number of copies of data, each on a separate machine. TigerGraph Cloud currently supports a replication factor of up to three for TigerGraph v3.0.6+.

If you don't need additional copies of your data, enter 1 as your replication factor.

If you provision a cluster with a replication factor higher than 1:

* If your solution is on AWS or GCP, the replicas are automatically provisioned on different availability zones.
* A load balancer is automatically  attached to your cluster to balance traffic between the replicas.

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster is on GCP and it has a replication factor higher than 1, you won't be able to use ports 9000 and 14240 to access API endpoints. Instead, you can access the endpoints using HTTPS requests on port 443:

* To access the endpoints that normally listen on port 9000,  append/restpp after the domain and before the endpoint. Since an HTTPS request already implies port 443, specifying the port is optional. However, you need to ensure that you are making HTTPS requests instead of HTTP requests.
** Example: To access the /echo endpoint: ``curl "https://examplesolution.i.tgcloud.io/restpp/echo"``
* To access the endpoints that normally listen on port 14240, use the original endpoint address, but on port 443. Similar to port 9000 requests, specifying the port is optional.
** Example: To access the health check endpoint on 14240:
``curl "https://examplesolution.i.tgcloud.io/api/ping"``
* Access to GraphStudio is not affected: opening the domain of the solution in a browser will directly take you to GraphStudio

=== 6. Enter solution settings

==== 6.1. Name and tag your solution

Give your solution a name. A solution name can only contain alphanumeric characters, space, dash, and underscore and may be no longer than 20 characters.

Give your solution a tag, which helps you sort and identify your solutions. A solution tag may be no longer than 40 characters and can contain any character.

==== 6.2. Set initial password

When a solution is provisioned, a default xref:security:manage-database-users.adoc[TigerGraph user] `tigergraph` is created in the installation process.
The password you set here will be the initial password for the `tigergraph` user.

[NOTE]
====
This initial password allows you to log into the database when your solution is in the ready state. If you forget this password, you will need to terminate and recreate the solution.
====

==== 6.3. Set a subdomain

Enter a unique subdomain for your solution. Only letters, numbers, and a connecting hyphen `-` between words are allowed in the subdomain. You can send HTTP requests to the REST endpoints on the domain once the solution is up and running. If you do not enter a subdomain, an automatically generated subdomain will be assigned to the solution.

==== 6.4. Enter a description

Enter a description of what the solution is used for or anything else you would like to note about this solution.

=== 7. Review and confirm.

After making sure all your settings are correct, click *Submit* to start your solution. Your solution should be ready after a brief warm-up period.
