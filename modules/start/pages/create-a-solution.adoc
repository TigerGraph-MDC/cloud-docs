= Create a Solution
:experimental:

TigerGraph Cloud solutions offer a full-scale analytics platform to store and query your graph data.

This page will guide you through the process of creating a *free-tier* solution (subject to xref:reference:service-limits.adoc[limits]).

[CAUTION]
====
Free-tier solutions are for training, learning, and small-scale proof of concept use cases. Free-tier solutions do not support backup and restore.

For more advanced testing and learning, consider adding a payment method and using paid-tier solutions to access the backup and restore feature.
