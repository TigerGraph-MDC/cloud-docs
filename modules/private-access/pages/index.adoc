= Private Access Services

TigerGraph offers private access services through AWS (AWS PrivateLink), Azure (Azure Private Link), and GCP (Private Service Connect).

This section includes instructions on setting up private access through TigerGraph Cloud.

This feature is only available to new solutions on regions that support private endpoints, not solutions existing before the feature release.
If your solution was active before this feature was released in June 2022, you cannot create a private link in that region. Please contact TigerGraph support for information about upgrading to be able to create private links.

Private access services are only available for paid solutions.

== Setup overview

. Create a new solution on Tigergraph Cloud

. Choose "Private" or "Public" for the "TigerGraph Endpoint Type"

. Connect the new solution to your account with the cloud provider

See each solution's main page for a detailed guide.
