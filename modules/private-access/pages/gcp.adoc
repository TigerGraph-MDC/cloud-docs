:description: Setting up Private Service Connect on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This page describes the setup process for Private Service Connect.
You need a GCP account to use this feature.

== GCP General Workflow

Begin creating a paid-tier solution in a region that supports private access.

Select “Private“ for the TigerGraph Endpoint Type.

Fill in your GCP Project ID and define a connection limit.

Behind the scenes, TigerGraph will provision a Private Service Connect service and provide you with a Service Attachment name.

In the GCP portal, create a Private Service Connect endpoint using the service name above.

Confirm on the TGCloud Portal that the endpoint has been created and TigerGraph will automatically approve it.

=== Instructions
==== Private Service Connect endpoint
Verify that a dedicated subnet with Purpose set to “None“ exists in GCP to contain the Private Service Connect endpoint.

Create a static IP address for the Private Service Connect endpoint in that subnet.

In the GCP portal, search for btn:[Private Service Connect] and click btn:[Connect Endpoint].

In the btn:[Target] field, choose btn:[Published service]. Use the service name provided by TigerGraph as the btn:[Target Service].
Choose the Subnetwork and IP address services provided earlier. Click btn:[Add Endpoint].

Return to the Private service connect section and allow a few minutes to wait. On approval, the Endpoint displays a Status value of Accepted.

==== Create endpoint via CLI

First create a subnetwork:

[source.wrap, bash]
----
gcloud compute networks subnets create <subnetwork_name> --project=<customer_project> --range=<subnet_cidr_in_customer_network> --network=<customer_network> --region=<region>
----

Then create a static IP address for the Private Service Connect endpoint:

[source.wrap, bash]
----
gcloud compute addresses create <static_ip_address_name> --region=<region> --subnet=<name_of_subnet_from_step_1> --addresses <ip_address_in_network_from_step_1>
----

Add the endpoint:

[source.wrap, bash]
----
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create <forwarding_rule_name> --region=<region> --network=<customer_network_name> --address=<static_ip_address_name_from_step_2> --target-service-attachment=<URI_from_TG_cloud>
----


==== Private DNS
Create a Private DNS Zone named `privatelink.i.tgcloud.io`

In the new DNS zone, add a DNS A record named `{solutiondomain}`  (example: `test-solution`).
The value is the private static IP address for Private Service Connect.
