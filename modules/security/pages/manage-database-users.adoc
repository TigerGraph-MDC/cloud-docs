= Manage Database Users

On the solution level, the same xref:3.2@gui:admin-portal:management/user-management.adoc[role-based access control] used by the on-prem version of TigerGraph also applies to TigerGraph Cloud. Each solution or solution cluster can have many TigerGraph users and each user can have different roles for each graph with different privileges.

To learn how to manage users and roles in Admin Portal, refer to the xref:3.2@gui:admin-portal:management/user-management.adoc[User Management] section in xref:3.2@gui:admin-portal:overview.adoc[Admin Portal UI Guide].
